          <p>moving to MPDX® presents an unprecedented opportunity to improve our skills as missionaries. Most staff received training on an MPD® tool when they first joined staff, however have few opportunities to learn new technology as it is released. This move to MPDX®gives us the chance to train all staff in the same tools at the same time to increase our skills and effectiveness in MPD®. </p>
